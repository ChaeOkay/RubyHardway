KEYWORDS
alias = reuses an existing method
and = false unless both sides are true
BEGIN = automatically is run as first line of block code
begin = starts a multi line comment =begin
break = stops a loop
case = statement operator, consists of optional condition
class = definition block, can be called as an object
def = signals a method definition
defined? = tests if an expression refer to anything
do = signals the start of a block
else = the other part of a conditional statement
elsif = additional conditional statements
END = automatically runs as last line of block code
end = end of an body of arguments
ensure = take a return value in a block but isn't remembered
false = not true
for = signals to loop for a certain condition
if = signals condition and subsequent code if condition is met
in = synonymous with for
module = block of code that can call on itself with self
next = skips if condition is true 
nil = nothing
not = boolean for opposite of condition
or = true unless both sides are false
redo = causes unconditional repeate of block of code
rescue = exception handling clause
retry = inside of a rescue clause, tells ruby to execute again
return = takes an optional argument, and is the return value of a method
self = calls on the class
super = looks up the method above
then = explains what happen if a condition is met
true = opposite of false
undef = undefines a method
unless = opposite of if
until = opposite of while, assumes false until condition is ture
when = synonymous with case
while = assumes true until condition is met
yield = inserts a defined block into something thats called

DATA TYPES
true = boolean 
false = boolean
nil = nothing
constant = definition can't be changed
strings = alpha 
ranges = extents of numbers
arrays = list that is indexed
hash = list of key/values

\\ = single backslash
\' = single quote
\" = double quote
\a = alert
\b = backspace

\v = vertical tab

OPERATORS
 :: = calls on class or module from the outside
 [] = new array
 ** = exponent
 -(unary) = takes only one "argument" (1+2 would be "+1 2")
 +(unary) = same as above but subtracts
 ! = not
 ~ = flips
 * = multiply
 / = divide
 % = modulo
 + = add
 - = subtract
 << = push left
 >> = push right
 & = and
 | = or
 > = greater than
 >= = greater or equal than
 <=> = order, returns -1, 0, or +1 
 == = equals
 === = sets equal to true
 != = not equal
 =~ = pattern match
 !~ = not pattern match
 && = and - false unless both conditions are true
 || = or - true unless both conditions are false
 .. = incusive range, includes last number
 ... = exclusive range, does not include last number
